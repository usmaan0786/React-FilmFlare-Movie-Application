# FilmFlare-Movie-Application

## Abstract:

The project is a React-based web application that leverages The Movie Database (TMDB) API to provide users with a comprehensive platform for exploring movies, actors, and genres. The application offers features such as browsing popular movies, top-rated movies, upcoming releases, and searching for specific titles. Users can also discover detailed information about movies, including cast members, genres, and recommendations. The platform incorporates dynamic pages for actors, showcasing their biographies and a selection of movies they have participated in. Additionally, users can explore movie trailers, websites, and IMDb links. The project utilizes Redux for state management, enabling seamless interaction between different components. Tailwind CSS ensures an aesthetically pleasing and responsive user interface, while React Router facilitates smooth navigation across the application. The result is an engaging and user-friendly movie exploration platform with detailed actor profiles and a visually appealing interface.

## Navbar:

- The project's navigation begins with a minimalist Navbar featuring the developer's name and profile picture.
- Search option dynamically appears exclusively on the main or movies page, enhancing user interaction. The Search functionality utilizes an event handler that processes user queries and displays corresponding results. This is facilitated by a Redux setup, including the implementation of a searchMovie action creator, a corresponding reducer, and the integration with the Redux store.

- The Sidebar component, on the other hand, employs custom hooks to seamlessly handle genre and category attributes. Through user interactions with the sidebar, the application dynamically showcases results based on the selected actions. 
- This responsive design approach enhances the user experience, allowing for convenient, streamlined and user-friendly interface.







# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
